# Defining Functions

#def my_function():
    # Do this
    # Then do this
    # Finally do this

# calling function

# my_function() # just call that function

# for loop
# when you want to do something with items

# While
# when you perform some type of functionality many many times then use while loop


# While loop is little bit dangrous

# in case of for loop you know the end( mean stop when reaches to the end)

# on the other end while continues running if the condition is true
# take atmost care while using while loop
